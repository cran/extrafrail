Description: Provide estimation and data generation tools for some new multivariate frailty models.
             This version includes the gamma, inverse Gaussian, weighted Lindley, Birnbaum-Saunders,
	     truncated normal, mixture of inverse Gaussian, mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders and 
             generalized exponential as the distribution for the frailty terms. For the basal model,
             it is considered a parametric approach based on the exponential, Weibull and the 
             piecewise exponential distributions as well as a semiparametric approach. 
             For details, see Gallardo and Bourguignon (2025) <doi:10.1002/bimj.70044> and
             Gallardo et al. (2024) <doi:10.1007/s11222-024-10458-w>.
