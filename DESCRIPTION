Description: Provide estimation and data generation tools for some new multivariate frailty models.
             This initial version includes only the weighted Lindley as the distribution for the frailty terms. 
             For the basal model, it is considered a parametric approach based on the Weibull distribution 
             and a semiparametric approach. For details, see Gallardo and Bourguignon (2022) 
             <arXiv:2206.12973>.
