Description: Provide estimation and data generation tools for some new multivariate frailty models.
             This version includes the gamma, inverse Gaussian, weighted Lindley, Birnbaum-Saunders,
	     truncated normal, mixture of inverse Gaussian and mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders as the 
             distribution for the frailty terms. For the basal model, it is considered a parametric 
             approach based on the exponential, Weibull and the piecewise exponential distributions 
             as well as a semiparametric approach. 
             For details, see Gallardo and Bourguignon (2022) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2206.12973> and
             Gallardo et al. (2024) <doi:10.1007/s11222-024-10458-w>.
