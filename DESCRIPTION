Description: Provide estimation and data generation tools for some new multivariate frailty models.
             This version includes the gamma, inverse Gaussian, weighted Lindley and Birnbaum-Saunders
	     as the distribution for the frailty terms. 
             For the basal model, it is considered a parametric approach based on the exponential, 
             Weibull and the piecewise exponential distributions as well as a semiparametric approach. 
             For details, see Gallardo and Bourguignon (2022) <arXiv:2206.12973>.
