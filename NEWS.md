### 1.7

* option TN (truncated normal) was added in frailty.fit function

### 1.6

* fixed bugs in summary.extrafrail function to compute p-values

### 1.5

* option exp (exponential) was added in frailty.fit function as baseline model
* fixed bugs in summary.extrafrail function for pe distribution as baseline model

### 1.4

* option pe (piecewise exponential) was added in frailty.fit function as baseline model

### 1.3

* option BS (Birnbaum-Saunders) was added in frailty.fit function

### 1.2

* fixed bugs in summary.extrafrail function

### 1.1

* function frailtyWL was deprecated
* function frailty.fit was included. Besides the shared weighted Lindley frailty model, this
  function allows to perform estimation for the shared gamma and shared inverse gaussian frailty 
  models.
